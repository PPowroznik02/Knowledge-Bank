# Docker Basics

## Docker Engine

Open-source technology that includes a server running a background process called a REST API, and a command-line interface (CLI) known as `docker`.

## Docker Daemon

Manages and runs Docker containers and handles their creation. It acts as a server in Docker's setup, receiving requests and commands from other components.

## Docker Image

A Docker image is a template containing a set of instructions for creating a container that can run on the Docker platform. It provides a convenient way to package applications and preconfigured environments.

## Docker Container

A Docker container is a lightweight, standalone, executable package of software that includes everything needed to run an application: code, runtime, system tools, libraries, and settings.

## Container Orchestration

Container orchestration is the process of automating the deployment, management, scaling, and networking of containers throughout their lifecycle. It enables consistent software deployment across different environments at scale.

## Common Docker Commands

```bash
# Start container from image, detached in the background
docker run -d <image_name>

# Start container image with interactive shell
docker run -it <image_name>

# Start container with a custom name
docker run --name <container_name> <image_name>

# Start container with a specific command
docker run <image_name> <shell_command>

# Stop container
docker stop <container_name>

# Show all running containers
docker ps

# Filter containers by specific name
docker ps -f "name=<container_name>"

# Print all logs generated by container
docker logs <container_name>

# Print logs in real time
docker logs -f <container_name>

# Delete container
docker container rm <container_id>

# Pull image from Docker Hub community
docker pull <image_name>

# Pull specific version of image from Docker Hub
docker pull <image_name>:<image_version>

# List all available images
docker images

# Delete image (only works if no running containers use it)
docker image rm <image_name>

# Delete all stopped containers
docker container prune

# Delete all dangling images
docker image prune

# Delete all images
docker image prune -a

# Rename image
docker tag <image_name> <new_image_name>
```

Docker registry:
A Docker registry is a storage and distribution system for Docker images. Docker Registry is open source, and anyone can run their own private registry. Images stored in a Docker Registry often begin with the registry's URL

```bash
# Pull a Docker image from a specific registry
docker pull <image_url>/<image_name>:<image_version>

# Push a Docker image to a specific registry
docker push <image_url>/<image_name>:<image_version>

# Authenticate to a private registry
docker login <image_url>

# Save image to a file
docker save -o <file_name> <image_name>:<image_version>

# Load image from a file
docker load -i <file_name>

```

Dockerfile:
A Dockerfile contains all the instructions needed to build a Docker image.

```bash
# Build image from Dockerfile
docker build <dockerfile_path>

# Build image from Dockerfile with a specific name
docker build -t <image_name> .

```

## Dockerfile Commands

| Command      | Description                                                             |
| ------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `FROM`       | Sets the base image (must be the first command)                         |
| `RUN`        | Executes a command in a new layer (e.g., installing software)           |
| `CMD`        | Sets the default command to run when a container starts                 |
| `COPY`       | Copies files/directories from local context to image                    |
| `ADD`        | Like COPY but also supports remote URLs and auto-extraction of archives |
| `WORKDIR`    | Sets the working directory inside the container                         |
| `ENV`        | Sets an environment variable                                            |
| `EXPOSE`     | Documents the port the container will listen on                         |
| `ENTRYPOINT` | Configures a container to run as an executable                          |
| `VOLUME`     | Creates a mount point for persistent or shared data                     |
| `ARG`        | Defines build-time variables                                            |
| `LABEL`      | Adds metadata to an image (e.g., author, version)                       |
| `USER`       | Sets the user under which the container will run                        |
